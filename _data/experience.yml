    I was working on Project Sidewalk which tried to crowd source street accesibility. 
    I conduced studies on improving, precision, recall and const savings by training various
    learning models (like <mark>ResNet</mark>) to detect accesibility in cities. 
    I also optimized library to get predictions from the neural network using <mark>memonization</mark> and multi-processing techniques to increase the processing speed

      I designed a custom user interface (<mark>PYQT</mark>) system to easily operate the robot at depths up to 16 ft underwater. I also utilized <mark>Gaussian elimination</mark> along with <mark>OPENCV</mark> to create an autonomous driver system with five degrees of freedom. 
      Finally, I engineered machine learning models to detect benthic species and track the health of coral colonies using <mark>TensorFlow</mark>. 
      Our team placed <mark>12th</mark> at the International ROV Competition and <mark>2nd</mark> at the PNW ROV Competition.
