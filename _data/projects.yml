    The program starts off with a single pendulum swinging around a fixed point and the user can added magnets at various locations.
    Users can choose the type of magnets (attractive or repulsive based on the color) along the strength of the individual magnets. 
    Users can adjust the starting energy by choosing the starting angle of the pendulum at the start of the program.
